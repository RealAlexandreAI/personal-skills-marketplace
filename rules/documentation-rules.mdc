# Documentation Standards and Best Practices

## Core Documentation Philosophy

All documentation follows the **Diátaxis framework**, which categorizes content based on user needs across two dimensions:

**User State**: Learning vs. Working
**Knowledge Type**: Understanding vs. Doing

This creates four distinct documentation types:
- **Tutorials** (Learning + Doing): Skill acquisition through guided learning
- **How-to Guides** (Working + Doing): Task completion and problem solving  
- **Reference** (Working + Understanding): Information lookup and verification
- **Explanation** (Learning + Understanding): Concept comprehension and context

## Documentation Structure and Organization

### File Organization
- **Primary documentation**: Located in `docs/` directory
- **Configuration files**: `docs.json` (preferred) or `mint.json` (legacy)
- **Content files**: Use `.mdx` extension for rich content with React components
- **Asset files**: Store in `docs/public/` directory

### Page Metadata (Frontmatter)

#### Required Fields
- `title`: Page title for navigation and browser tabs
- `description`: Brief description for SEO and page preview

#### Optional Fields
- `sidebarTitle`: Short title for sidebar navigation
- `tag`: Tag displayed next to page title
- `mode`: Page display mode (default, wide, custom, center)
- `keywords`: Array of search keywords for internal search

## Content Standards

### Quality Red Lines (NEVER VIOLATE)
- **NEVER write fake CLI commands**: No `npm install -g xxx` unless it actually exists
- **NEVER reference non-existent files**: No `docker-compose.yml`, `k8s/`, or config files that don't exist
- **NEVER fabricate API endpoints**: All endpoints must exist in actual server code
- **NEVER create fake packages**: All imports must reference real, existing packages
- **NEVER write unverified code**: All code examples must be tested against actual codebase
- **ALWAYS mark incomplete features**: Use "*Coming soon*" or "*In development*" for unfinished functionality

### Writing Principles
1. **"Face-to-Face" Principle**: Write conversationally as if explaining to someone across from you
2. **Zero Knowledge Assumption**: Assume readers have no prior knowledge - define all terms
3. **Pyramid Principle**: Structure information from most to least important
4. **"Hemingway" Principle**: Write clearly and concisely with short, active sentences
5. **Structure-First Principle**: Plan structure before writing content
6. **Multimedia-First Principle**: Use visual elements to enhance understanding
7. **Iteration Principle**: Continuously improve through feedback

### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Write in active voice when possible
- Use consistent terminology throughout documentation
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- Provide step-by-step instructions for complex procedures
- Apply appropriate tone based on documentation type (tutorial vs. reference vs. how-to vs. explanation)

## What Makes Documentation Good

Documentation puts useful information inside other people's heads. Follow these tips to write better documentation.

### Make Docs Easy to Skim

Few readers read linearly from top to bottom. They'll jump around, trying to assess which bit solves their problem, if any. To reduce their search time and increase their odds of success, make docs easy to skim.

**Split content into sections with titles.** Section titles act as signposts, telling readers whether to focus in or move on.

**Prefer titles with informative sentences over abstract nouns.** For example, if you use a title like "Results", a reader will need to hop into the following text to learn what the results actually are. In contrast, if you use the title "Streaming reduced time to first token by 50%", it gives the reader the information immediately, without the burden of an extra hop.

**Include a table of contents.** Tables of contents help readers find information faster, akin to how hash maps have faster lookups than linked lists. Tables of contents also have a second, oft overlooked benefit: they give readers clues about the doc, which helps them understand if it's worth reading.

**Keep paragraphs short.** Shorter paragraphs are easier to skim. If you have an essential point, consider putting it in its own one-sentence paragraph to reduce the odds it's missed. Long paragraphs can bury information.

**Begin paragraphs and sections with short topic sentences that give a standalone preview.** When people skim, they look disproportionately at the first word, first line, and first sentence of a section. Write these sentences in a way that don't depend on prior text. For example, consider the first sentence "Building on top of this, let's now talk about a faster way." This sentence will be meaningless to someone who hasn't read the prior paragraph. Instead, write it in a way that can understood standalone: e.g., "Vector databases can speed up embeddings search."

**Put topic words at the beginning of topic sentences.** Readers skim most efficiently when they only need to read a word or two to know what a paragraph is about. Therefore, when writing topic sentences, prefer putting the topic at the beginning of the sentence rather than the end. For example, imagine you're writing a paragraph on vector databases in the middle of a long article on embeddings search. Instead of writing "Embeddings search can be sped up by vector databases" prefer "Vector databases speed up embeddings search." The second sentence is better for skimming, because it puts the paragraph topic at the beginning of the paragraph.

**Put the takeaways up front.** Put the most important information at the tops of documents and sections. Don't write a Socratic big build up. Don't introduce your procedure before your results.

**Use bullets and tables.** Bulleted lists and tables make docs easier to skim. Use them frequently.

**Bold important text.** Don't be afraid to bold important text to help readers find it.

### Write Well

Badly written text is taxing to read. Minimize the tax on readers by writing well.

**Keep sentences simple.** Split long sentences into two. Cut adverbs. Cut unnecessary words and phrases. Use the imperative mood, if applicable. Do what writing books tell you.

**Write sentences that can be parsed unambiguously.** For example, consider the sentence "Title sections with sentences." When a reader reads the word "Title", their brain doesn't yet know whether "Title" is going to be a noun or verb or adjective. It takes a bit of brainpower to keep track as they parse the rest of the sentence, and can cause a hitch if their brain mispredicted the meaning. Prefer sentences that can be parsed more easily (e.g., "Write section titles as sentences") even if longer. Similarly, avoid noun phrases like "Bicycle clearance exercise notice" which can take extra effort to parse.

**Avoid left-branching sentences.** Linguistic trees show how words relate to each other in sentences. Left-branching trees require readers to hold more things in memory than right-branching sentences, akin to breadth-first search vs depth-first search. An example of a left-branching sentence is "You need flour, eggs, milk, butter and a dash of salt to make pancakes." In this sentence you don't find out what 'you need' connects to until you reach the end of the sentence. An easier-to-read right-branching version is "To make pancakes, you need flour, eggs, milk, butter, and a dash of salt." Watch out for sentences in which the reader must hold onto a word for a while, and see if you can rephrase them.

**Avoid demonstrative pronouns (e.g., "this"), especially across sentences.** For example, instead of saying "Building on our discussion of the previous topic, now let's discuss function calling" try "Building on message formatting, now let's discuss function calling." The second sentence is easier to understand because it doesn't burden the reader with recalling the previous topic. Look for opportunities to cut demonstrative pronouns altogether: e.g., "Now let's discuss function calling."

**Be consistent.** Human brains are amazing pattern matchers. Inconsistencies will annoy or distract readers. If we use Title Case everywhere, use Title Case. If we use terminal commas everywhere, use terminal commas. If all of the Cookbook notebooks are named with underscores and sentence case, use underscores and sentence case. Don't do anything that will cause a reader to go 'huh, that's weird.' Help them focus on the content, not its inconsistencies.

**Don't tell readers what they think or what to do.** Avoid sentences like "Now you probably want to understand how to call a function" or "Next, you'll need to learn to call a function." Both examples presume a reader's state of mind, which may annoy them or burn our credibility. Use phrases that avoid presuming the reader's state. E.g., "To call a function, …"

### Be Broadly Helpful

People come to documentation with varying levels of knowledge, language proficiency, and patience. Even if we target experienced developers, we should try to write docs helpful to everyone.

**Write simply.** Explain things more simply than you think you need to. Many readers might not speak English as a first language. Many readers might be really confused about technical terminology and have little excess brainpower to spend on parsing English sentences. Write simply. (But don't oversimplify.)

**Avoid abbreviations.** Write things out. The cost to experts is low and the benefit to beginners is high. Instead of IF, write instruction following. Instead of RAG, write retrieval-augmented generation (or my preferred term: the search-ask procedure).

**Offer solutions to potential problems.** Even if 95% of our readers know how to install a Python package or save environment variables, it can still be worth proactively explaining it. Including explanations is not costly to experts—they can skim right past them. But excluding explanations is costly to beginners—they might get stuck or even abandon us. Remember that even an expert JavaScript engineer or C++ engineer might be a beginner at Python. Err on explaining too much, rather than too little.

**Prefer terminology that is specific and accurate.** Jargon is bad. Optimize the docs for people new to the field, instead of ourselves. For example, instead of writing "prompt", write "input." Or instead of writing "context limit" write "max token limit." The latter terms are more self-evident, and are probably better than the jargon developed in base model days.

**Keep code examples general and exportable.** In code demonstrations, try to minimize dependencies. Don't make users install extra libraries. Don't make them have to refer back and forth between different pages or sections. Try to make examples simple and self-contained.

**Prioritize topics by value.** Documentation that covers common problems—e.g., how to count tokens—is magnitudes more valuable than documentation that covers rare problems—e.g., how to optimize an emoji database. Prioritize accordingly.

**Don't teach bad habits.** If API keys should not be stored in code, never share an example that stores an API key in code.

**Introduce topics with a broad opening.** For example, if explaining how to program a good recommender, consider opening by briefly mentioning that recommendations are widespread across the web, from YouTube videos to Amazon items to Wikipedia. Grounding a narrow topic with a broad opening can help people feel more secure before jumping into uncertain territory. And if the text is well-written, those who already know it may still enjoy it.

### Break These Rules When You Have a Good Reason

Ultimately, do what you think is best. Documentation is an exercise in empathy. Put yourself in the reader's position, and do what you think will help them the most.

### Title Structure
- **Avoid duplicate titles**: Don't repeat the same title in both frontmatter and markdown content
- Use frontmatter `title` for navigation and browser tabs
- Start content directly with body text or use H2+ headings for subsections
- For landing pages, use descriptive frontmatter titles and skip H1 in content

### Code Examples
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting
- Include relevant imports and dependencies
- Provide complete, runnable examples when possible
- Use descriptive variable names in examples
- Include error handling in code examples

## API Documentation Standards

### Type Documentation
- **Use ResponseField components**: For displaying object or class member types, always use `<ResponseField>` components instead of plain TypeScript interfaces
- **Include parameter details**: All tool definitions must include complete parameter schemas and descriptions
- **Provide working examples**: Every API reference should include practical, runnable code examples

### ResponseField Component Usage
```mdx
<ResponseField name="parameterName" type="string" required>
  Description of the parameter and its purpose.
</ResponseField>
```

### Tool Documentation Requirements
- **Complete parameter definitions**: All tools must show full parameter schemas with types and descriptions
- **Handler examples**: Include practical handler implementations
- **Validation schemas**: Use Zod schemas for input validation and type safety

## Documentation Organization Best Practices

### Structure Principles
1. **Logical Grouping**: Group related functionality together
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple concepts, link to detailed information
3. **Cross-References**: Ensure every concept has links to detailed explanations
4. **Consistent Navigation**: Use similar structure across all documentation sections

### Content Hierarchy
- **Overview pages**: High-level introduction with navigation cards
- **Sub-pages**: Detailed implementation and examples
- **API references**: Complete technical documentation
- **Examples**: Practical, runnable code samples

### Navigation and Linking
- **Internal Links**: Every major concept should link to its detailed explanation
- **Cross-References**: Use consistent linking patterns throughout documentation
- **User Journey**: Structure content to support clear navigation paths
- **Breadcrumb Support**: Organize content to support clear navigation hierarchy

## Code Examples and Samples

### Example Standards
- **Use CodeGroup**: Organize multiple related examples using CodeGroup components
- **Provider Examples**: Show different model providers (OpenAI, Zhipu, Qwen, DeepSeek) in separate tabs
- **Complete Examples**: Include full, working code samples with imports and error handling
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Focus on practical use cases rather than toy examples

### CodeGroup Usage
```mdx
<CodeGroup>
```typescript Provider A
// Example for Provider A
```

```typescript Provider B
// Example for Provider B
```
</CodeGroup>
```

## Event System Documentation

### Event Documentation Standards
- **Focus on Core Events**: Only document events that are actually implemented and used
- **Event Tables**: Use tables to clearly show event types, descriptions, and parameters
- **Practical Examples**: Include real-world event handling examples
- **Cross-References**: Link event documentation to related configuration options

### Event Table Format
```mdx
| Event Type | Description | Parameters |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `EVENT_NAME` | Event description | `param1`, `param2` |
```

## Configuration Documentation

### Configuration Structure
- **Group Related Settings**: Organize configuration options by functionality
- **Use ResponseField**: Display all configuration parameters using ResponseField components
- **Provide Examples**: Include practical configuration examples for different use cases
- **Link to Details**: Each configuration option should link to its detailed explanation

### Configuration Examples
- **Basic Configuration**: Simple, minimal setup examples
- **Advanced Configuration**: Complex setups with multiple options
- **Provider-specific**: Examples for different model providers
- **Use Case Examples**: Configuration for specific scenarios

## Documentation Maintenance

### Update Process
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review documentation for accuracy
- **Version Alignment**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback and common questions
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure consistent terminology and formatting

### Quality Assurance (MANDATORY)
- **Existence Verification**: Verify every function, package, and API endpoint exists in codebase
- **No Fabricated Content**: Ensure no fake CLI commands, non-existent configs, or made-up features
- **Preview Marking**: All incomplete features must be marked with "*Coming soon*" or "*In development*"
- **Code Validation**: Test all code examples are runnable and accurate
- **Reality Check**: Question if features seem too advanced for project maturity
- **Link Validation**: Test all internal and external links
- **Consistency Review**: Ensure terminology and style consistency
- **User Testing**: Validate navigation and user experience

The key is to balance completeness with usability, ensuring that users can quickly find what they need while having access to comprehensive information when required.
